# Annotation Tools

This repository hosts a growing collection of lightweight, browser-based annotation tools built for use in our lab.

These tools are:

- Easy to run locally (just a browser + Python HTTP server)
- Fully customizable for your data and task
- Designed to speed up annotation and reduce manual errors

Each tool lives in its own folder and comes with its own README. You can clone the repo and modify any tool to match your project needs.
