I tried Tiki Cat but not only are my cats not eating it for some reason (you think they'd love such good food??) but its also very expensive, so I'm scoping for cheaper options. Does anyone have experience with Dave's Pet Food? Can someone familiar with cat nutrition tell me if these ingredients are good? Having the meats at the first ingredients is a big green flag, but I see a lot of vegetables and long science-y sounding words that I don't know what they are.",

    "post_body": "Hey all\nSo normally my cats eat fancy feast pate, I'll split a can between the two for dinner and free feed dry all day. But I was recently given a case of friskies shreds by someone who lost their cat. I've started giving it to my cats to use it up and free is free, and they are eating way more of it compared to the pate which they rarely finish.\nAm I going down in quality if I switch to friskies shreds going forward? Or are fancy feast pate and friskies shreds comparable enough that I can just buy more as my cats like it more? They seem to cost similar amounts, so quality/nutritional value is what I am not sure about.\nAnd I know neither of them are great quality, but I am working with what I have and at the end of the day, my cats are fed happy and healthy.",

    "post_body": "TL;DR - thoughts on fancy feast wet food? Is it healthy enough to feed a cat long term because he loves it?\nEdit: I know this post is rather old now, but it still gets comments so I thought I'd update. My orange baby is not so much a baby anymore and he now has his other half of a Halloween duo. They're both doing well and are healthy, though my orange is a little chunky (not overweight according to my vet). I'm pleased to say that I've got my cats eating something OTHER than fancy feast lol they've taken a liking to tiki cat after dark chicken pâté. It's similar enough to fancy feast in texture, which turns out to be their biggest issue. Just thought I'd give that little update for those interested! Thank you to all the amazing people who've given their advice and support in the comments over the past year or so. It really did help me as a new cat owner to not feel as terrible about what brands I pick. :))\nHey y'all. I've got a 1 and a half year old orange beast of an American shorthair. For some background, I had gotten him from a work friend who's mechanic had him living in their garage. My work friend was going to keep him, but his other cat was not fond of the new addition, so he fell into my care. At the time, he was only a few months old and seemed to have been perhaps separated from his mother, who was likely also a stray, a little bit too soon (he has some odd tendencies, such sucking on things, mainly his own fur). He was given to me on a diet of cheap dry food, which I did not like. I slowly switched him over and he seems to really enjoy the dry food he eats now.\nThe issue comes in here; I started him on wet food because I wanted him to have a combination diet. Cool, fine, and at the time I stupidly started him on fancy feast. I knew that was not what I wanted to keep him on, but I wanted to look into more brands and thought some wet food would be better than none. My plan was to make sure his stomach could handle dry and wet, then invest in a more healthy, expensive brand. I quickly learned that he is a VERY picky eater when it comes to wet food (and treats). He refuses to eat anything but fancy feast and will let his wet food sit till it gets gross rather than eat something new. I've tried mixing his old and new wet food, but he'll either eat around the new stuff or just not eat it altogether.\nSo, have I created a problem for my little guy or am I just being dramatic? I fully accept that perhaps I am, but I really just want the best for my cat. He seems happy, energetic, always purring and loving on my mom and I. He's my little shadow around the house and weighs a healthy amount. The vet was very pleased by him when I first brought him in, as he seemed to be doing well for being a recently-adopted-stray (aside from his fleas from hell and worms from said fleas, both now gone). The fact he's so happy makes me believe I'm doing too much over a petty issue, but he's my first cat and would love to hear from people who've had their cats longer than I have.",
